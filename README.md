# Microcontoller-Final-using-I2C-SPI-GPIOs-RTC
## This final project is the accumulation of all the topics we learn during my microcontollers class:
* GPIOs
* A/D Converter
 * D/A Converter
 * Temperature sensor
*  Light sensor
 * PWM â€“ Fan & speaker
* Timer and Counters
 * System interrupts
 * TFT interface
* I2C bus
* SPI bus
* RTC

### The final project will integrate a design that will have the following functions:
* A TFT panel used as a main display.
* A digital clock with the time/date programmable through a remote control.
* A digital clock with an alarm function with the time programmable through a remote
control. The alarm will sound a sound when the alarm is matched. The sound is reset
through a push-button switch. A multi-color LED is activated when the alarm sounds.
* A thermostat function that will turn on a heater when the temperature is below a
programmable temperature.
* A light sensor will activate a LED when the light is below a light threshold.
* A light dimmer controlled through the remote control
